#Graph Drawing

(University mini project: Polytech Nantes - Knowledge-based systems)

## Description
Given an application that simulates the behavior of a crowd of people on a process. Every person has a unique set of friends that he trusts individually (determined through a number) that does not necessarily correlate with the value of the friend. This friendship relation can be represented as a weighted, directed graph where the vertices are persons and the weighted, directed edges are the esteem that a certain person has for the destination vertice. The higher the value, the higher the trust.
